# Developer Iteration Notes — Agent5 (Deliveriii)

This journal captures design decisions, tradeoffs, and implementation details across iterations.

## Iteration 1: Project Scaffolding & Architecture

Placeholder for dev notes.

- Monorepo initialization with pnpm workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`).
- Base TypeScript config, ESLint/Prettier, Husky/lint-staged.
- Vite React app skeleton, Fastify API skeleton.
- Docker Compose for Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, MinIO.
- Helm chart skeletons for Kubernetes.

## Iteration 2: Data Model & Core Entities

Placeholder for dev notes.

- Prisma schema (`User`, `Package`, `AuditEntry`, `DeliveryEvent`, `Attachment`), enums, and indexes.
- Seed data and smoke tests.

## Iteration 3: Security, Auth, RBAC

Placeholder for dev notes.

- JWT in HttpOnly cookies (access/refresh with rotation via Redis), RBAC guards, rate limits, Zod validation, CORS + Helmet CSP.
- MFA stubs (server-side togglable).

## Iteration 4: API: Packages, Audit, Attachments

Placeholder for dev notes.

- CRUD for packages, scan endpoints (apply events/audit), audit and attachments presign.
- Elasticsearch write-through for package and audit indexing.

## Iteration 5: Realtime Socket.IO & Eventing

Placeholder for dev notes.

- `/rt` namespace with Redis adapter, cookie-based auth, role and package rooms.
- Emit events on package mutations and scans; heartbeat/backpressure tuned.
- Web hooks to subscribe (admin, driver, package rooms).

## Iteration 6: Web App UI (PWA, Scanner)

Placeholder for dev notes.

- React Router pages (Admin, Driver, Package Detail).
- ZXing-js camera scanner overlay; batch/manual modes; haptics/beep.
- Service worker caches GETs and queues POST `/api/v1/scan` for background sync.
- Zustand slices for auth, packages, scanner, realtime; theme toggle.

## Iteration 7: Observability, Performance, Security Hardening

Placeholder for dev notes.

- Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured logs; assert web budgets with Lighthouse CI.
- CSRF, strict cookies, IP allowlist; brute-force login throttling.

## Iteration 8: CI/CD, Helm, Docs, Testing — Detailed Notes

### What I changed

- Metrics: Prometheus client with default metrics; HTTP latency histogram (`http_request_duration_seconds`), requests total (`http_requests_total`), 5xx counter (`http_request_errors_total`); WS gauges (`ws_connections`, `ws_connections_total`). `/metrics` endpoint added.
- Logging: Request/response summaries with correlation IDs (`x-request-id`) via Fastify hooks; Prisma slow query logging.
- Security: Helmet CSP already in place; tightened flow with strict cookies and CSRF double-submit token for non-GETs.
- CSRF: Issue `csrf_token` on login/register; require `X-CSRF-Token` header in state-changing v1 routes.
- Brute-force: Redis counters keyed by IP+email for failed logins with TTL.
- IP allowlist: Optional CIDR allowlist gate configurable via `IP_ALLOWLIST_CIDRS`.
- Dashboards: Added Grafana JSON dashboards for API and Socket metrics under `charts/grafana/dashboards`.
- Lighthouse CI: Added `lighthouserc.json` and root script to run against `apps/web` preview; WebPageTest config added.
- DB indexes: Added `@@index([driverId, status])` to `Package` and `@@index([createdAt])` to `Attachment`; Prisma middleware to time queries with `db_query_duration_seconds` histogram.
- Docs: `SECURITY.md` with STRIDE-lite; expanded root `README.md` and added `DEV_NOTES.md`.
- Env changes: `.env.example` gained `IP_ALLOWLIST_CIDRS` and `CSRF_ENABLED`.

### Files added/edited

- Added: `apps/api/src/metrics.ts`, `SECURITY.md`, `lighthouserc.json`, `webpagetest.json`, `charts/grafana/dashboards/api-metrics.json`, `charts/grafana/dashboards/socket-metrics.json`, `charts/grafana/README.md`, `DEV_NOTES.md`.
- Edited: `apps/api/src/index.ts`, `apps/api/src/realtime.ts`, `apps/api/src/config.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1/{scan.ts,packages.ts,attachments.ts,audit.ts}`, `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`, `apps/api/.env.example`, `apps/web/src/scanner/ScannerOverlay.tsx`, `apps/web/public/sw.js`, root `README.md`, root `package.json`, `apps/web/package.json`.

### What I ran and results

- Installed API deps: `prom-client`, `ip-cidr`; root dev deps: `wait-on`, `@lhci/cli`.
- API build: PASS (tsc). Web build: PASS (Vite). Production audit: PASS (no known vulnerabilities for prod deps).

### How to use it

- Prometheus: Scrape `http://<api-host>:3000/metrics`; import Grafana dashboards from `charts/grafana/dashboards`.
- IP allowlist: Set `IP_ALLOWLIST_CIDRS` (comma-separated CIDRs) to enable allowlist gating.
- CSRF: Client must send `X-CSRF-Token` header equal to `csrf_token` cookie for non-GET requests. Web scanner and SW already handle this.
- Lighthouse CI: From repo root, run `pnpm build` then `pnpm lh:ci` to assert budgets; see `lighthouserc.json`.

### Requirements coverage

- Metrics & dashboards: Implemented and exposed; dashboards included.
- Logging & correlation IDs: Implemented summaries and correlation.
- Security defenses: CSRF, brute-force, IP allowlist, strict cookies, Helmet CSP.
- Performance budgets: Lighthouse CI and WebPageTest config added.
- DB performance: Key indexes added; query timings via Prisma middleware.
- Deliverables: `/metrics`, Grafana dashboards, Lighthouse CI config, `SECURITY.md` provided.

### Next steps

- Add Snyk scanning in CI; configure alerts in Grafana (p95 > 500ms, error rate > 0.1%).
- E2E test suite (Playwright) for auth/scan/realtime; integration tests for API routes.
- Helm values for Prometheus scrape and Grafana provisioning.
- PgBouncer deployment and connection tuning guidance.
